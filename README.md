# Autonomous Navigation for TurtleBot3 Using Custom PID Controller

This project focuses on developing an autonomous navigation system for the TurtleBot3 robot. The system allows the robot to reach a user-specified location with precise yaw orientation using a custom-tuned PID controller. An innovative exponential decay factor was implemented to improve the robot's efficiency in managing large angular errors while maintaining speed, which significantly enhances path correction and overall navigation stability. The project demonstrates proficiency in Python, ROS (Robot Operating System), and real-time control systems.
