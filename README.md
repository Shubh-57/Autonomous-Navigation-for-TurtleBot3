# Autonomous Navigation for TurtleBot3 Using Custom PID Controller

Developed an autonomous navigation system for the TurtleBot3 robot, enabling it to reach a user-specified location with precise yaw orientation using a custom-tuned PID controller. Implemented an innovative exponential decay factor to enhance the robot's efficiency in handling large angular errors while maintaining speed, significantly improving path correction and overall navigation stability. Demonstrated proficiency in Python, ROS (Robot Operating System), and real-time control systems.
